# FullCalendar Component
-------------
FullCalendar Component is a Servoy Web Package containing the implementation of the JQuery fullcalendar plugin as a Servoy Web Component.

Requirements
-------------
The FullCalendar Component  can be used on Servoy 8.1.0 or higher.


Getting started
-------------
To add the FullCalendar Component package in your solution, open the Servoy Developer IDE and download the Servoy Extra Components from the Web Package Manager (the Web Package Manager is accessible from the context menu of the Web Components node of your solution).

To use the latest source code clone the git repository and checkout the develop branch. Install the [egit](http://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/) plugin for Eclipse to clone the repository and import the projects into the workspace.

Because of the known issue in 8.1.0 'A package (like servoy-extra and then the DBTreeView) that has a server side js can't be used as a zipped package (downloaded from WebPackageManager),
the FullCalendar component cannot be installed via the Web Package Manager, or be imported as a binary zip in the 8.1.0 Servoy release. 
To use the FullCalendar Component in 8.1.0 download the [fullcalendarcomponent.zip](https://github.com/Servoy/fullcalendarcomponent/releases/download/v1.0.1/fullcalendarcomponent.zip) and import it in Servoy Developer as a zip web package project.

To add the FullCalendar Component package in your solution download the [fullcalendarcomponent.zip] (https://github.com/Servoy/fullcalendarcomponent/releases/download/v1.0.0/fullcalendarcomponent.zip) and import it as a package project (the option to import the .zip file as a package project is accessible from the context menu of the Web Components node of your solution).
